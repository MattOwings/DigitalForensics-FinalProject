# Final Project for Intro to Digital Forensics

Using Steganography, a hidden message was embedded into the pixels of multiple image files, which can be extracted later. The purpose is to hide a message inside a seemingly innocent picture, often to get past investigators.

Tools used:
- Steganography
- Kali Linux

FinalProject-Stenanography.docx is the full report and paper for the project.
